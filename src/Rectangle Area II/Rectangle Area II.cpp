/* 
This problem is a 2D version of Merge Interval problem, i.e. merge
all the horizontal blocks going vertically


From solution: Line Sweep
-------------------------
Intuition

Imagine we pass a horizontal line from bottom to top over the shape. 
We have some active intervals on this horizontal line, which gets 
updated twice for each rectangle. In total, there are 2âˆ—N events, 
and we can update our (up to N) active horizontal intervals for each update.

Algorithm

For a rectangle like rec = [1,0,3,1], the first update is to add 
[1, 3] to the active set at y = 0, and the second update is to remove 
[1, 3] at y = 1. Note that adding and removing respects multiplicity - 
if we also added [0, 2] at y = 0, then removing [1, 3] at y = 1 will 
still leave us with [0, 2] active.

This gives us a plan: create these two events for each rectangle, 
then process all the events in sorted order of y. The issue now is 
deciding how to process the events add(x1, x2) and remove(x1, x2) 
such that we are able to query() the total horizontal length of our 
active intervals.

We can use the fact that our remove(...) operation will always be on 
an interval that was previously added. Let's store all the (x1, x2) 
intervals in sorted order. Then, we can query() in linear time using 
a technique similar to a classic LeetCode problem, Merge Intervals.


Below is sligghtly changed version of above algorithm but does the 
same thing, i.e. merge horizontally while going vertically

Scan from y = 0, count the coverage of rectangles on x.
For example, at y = 0, the intervale [0, 3] is covered by rectangles.
The current sum of coverage is 3.

Then we move our scan line upper to next y.
At y = 1, we add (1 - 0) * 3 = 3 to area. Now area = 3.
And we update the sum of coverage to 2 because it's coverd on [0, 2].

Then we move our scan line upper to next y.
At y = 2, we add (2 - 1) * 2 = 2 to area. Now area = 5.
And we update the sum of coverage to 1 because it's coverd on [1, 2].

Then we move our scan line upper to next y.
At y = 3, we add (3 - 2) * 1 = 1 to area. Now area = 6.
And we update the sum of coverage to 0.

The final result is 6.

Pseudocode:
1. Initialize a vector(x) with 0 and store all the x-coordinates
2. Sort this vector (x), and remove duplicates
3. Create a map, where key is x vector's value and value is it's index
4. Create a vector, count. 
    count[i] means the number of overlaps on the interval [x[i], x[i + 1]]
5. Create a vector of vector, L, which stores values like this
    1st value: height
    2nd value: extreme left x coordiante
    3rd value: extreme right x coordinate
    4th value: +1 for starting left coordinate point and -1 for ending right coordinate 
                point of rectangle provided in vector of vector: rectangles
                
6. Sort L, which essentially sort it based on height
7. For all the rectangles saved in L
    a. calculate and update area 
    b. update count vector
    c. initialize curr sweeping x area = 0
    d. calculate the sweeping x area based on updated count array
    
8. Return area
