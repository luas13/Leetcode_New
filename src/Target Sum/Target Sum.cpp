/*
The original problem statement is equivalent to:
Find a subset of nums that need to be positive, and the rest of them negative, such that the sum is equal to target

Let P be the positive subset and N be the negative subset
For example:
Given nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and target = 3 then one possible solution is +1-2+3-4+5 = 3
Here positive subset is P = [1, 3, 5] and negative subset is N = [2, 4]

Then letâ€™s see how this can be converted to a subset sum problem:

                  sum(P) - sum(N) = target
sum(P) + sum(N) + sum(P) - sum(N) = target + sum(P) + sum(N)
                       2 * sum(P) = target + sum(nums)

So the original problem has been converted to a subset sum problem as follows:
Find a subset P of nums such that sum(P) = (target + sum(nums)) / 2

Note that the above formula has proved that target + sum(nums) must be even
We can use that fact to quickly identify inputs that do not have a solution (Thanks to @BrunoDeNadaiSarnaglia for the suggestion)
